"""""
An interactive program to make a meadow of unique flowers.
Using mouse clicks, the program allows the user to specify the location and
    height of as many flowers as theyâ€™d like. When they are done making flowers
    they can quit the program by clicking on the black border at the bottom of
    the window.
